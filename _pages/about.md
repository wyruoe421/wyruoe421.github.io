Hi, I'm **Ling Yuan**. 

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Management at *Cardiff University*, funded by the [WGSSS Doctoral Training Partnership](https://wgsss.ac.uk/).  
My research focuses on improving **circular economic operations** by characterizing, forecasting, and managing **reverse logistics flows**, in collaboration with industrial partners such as **Brother Industries UK Ltd** and **The Royal Mint**.

Previously, I completed an **MRes in Management Science** at *Lancaster University*, where I worked on revenue management and pricing optimization for car rental systems. My undergraduate degree was in **Statistics** from *Suzhou University*, where I graduated top of my cohort.

## 🛠️ Tools & Open Access

I actively develop open-access analytical tools as part of my research:

- **[Event Study Tool](https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/event_study)** – Python package for financial event analysis  
- **[Event Analysis (R)](https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/EventAnalysis)** – R-based tool for market event impact assessment  
- **[Sentiment Analysis Tool](https://github.com/LINGYUAN1201/Sentiment_Analysis)** – Transformer-based sentiment pipeline

These tools are designed for advanced use cases and may require high-performance environments (e.g., strong CPUs/GPUs and sufficient bandwidth). I am continuously working on improving their performance and portability.

More tools can be found under the [**Open Access**](https://lingyuan1201.github.io/open-access/) section.
